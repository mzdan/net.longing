net.longing
===========

Net.longing explores how the internet and virtual relationships alter a memory over time.

As a set of text, it explores the influence of social technologies on how we recall and tell our stories. How do digital mediums, versioning, and imagined networks play a role in remembering and creating narratives?

The format mirrors the revision control technology that software developers use to track changes in code over the life of a project.

Revision control software preserves all changes over time, so that a user can revert to any version at any time. The memory at the center of this piece undergoes changes, but past versions are never deleted, and can be accessed at random — multiple versions and “branches” of the memory ultimately become trapped in an unnatural coexistence.
