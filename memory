I had everything, but something went wrong. He was a demon in a city of wind. I was in a wretched state, thinking about the kind of love that had been lost. Scheming and worry have yet to bring the love back.  But he must still love something about me. I am fairly sure. So I follow him around on different networks. This will lead to something; otherwise I can't bear it. But the network is a misunderstanding; an inescapable desire.
