I had everything, but I ruined it.
I was a demon in a city of wind.
I was terrible for losing a love that could have always survived.
Obsession and self-loathing have yet to bring the love back. 
But he must have loved me greatly.
I am sure, because of what happened between us.
So we follow each other on different networks. 
This will lead to something; it has to. 
The network holds the potential for resolution.
