We had a great thing, but it did not last. I was a passageway in a city of skyscrapers. It was terrible; the love was never going to survive. My focus had been mine alone; I merely imagined a digital gaze. What does it matter if he loved me.  Yet I am hopefully that we are still connected, somehow. Still I try to find him on different networks. This will lead to nothing; it does no good. The network is his perpetual departure, and I am nailed to the spot.
