I had everything, but lost it.
He was a skyscraper in a city of wind.
It was terrible to lose the kind of love that was going to survive.
Dedication, effort and attention have yet to bring the love back. 
But he must still love me.
I am sure. 
So I interact with him throughout different networks. 
This will lead to something, I am sure. 
The network is a place for the uncanny.
