I had something great, but it got lost. I was a tremptress in a city of fire. I was in a state of despair, realizing the love was not always going to survive. Vigilantly watching for signs is unlikely to bring the love back.  But he must have loved me then. I am almost certain, because we are still connected. So I watch what he does on different networks. This may lead to something; I'm not sure what. The network is the unimaginable; I cannot authenticate it.
